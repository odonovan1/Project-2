### ***Description***
#### This is a full-stack application that allows the user to access a API that stores the times from around the world and compare them on a certain page. User will be able to search places and have there timezones appear as well as select timezones to add to a dashboard that can be directley compared. Potentially I would like to involve weather as well. Using a search bar to access different places and storing the chosen timezones on the main page in an easy and inuitive way for the user.
